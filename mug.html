	<p>
	<li> I will certainly buy another!! </li>
	<li> Thank you, eDorf for this wonderful gift! I bought this mug for my grandma for her birthday. 
		Her only complaint was that it was "too beautiful to drink coffee out of." She said she
		will treasure it forever :) </li>
	<li> The design and the print is cool. The only thing is that it's a sturdy mug - for my moms 
		tea she likes drinking out of thinner mugs. </li>
	<li> BEST mug ever!!!!!!! </li>
	<li> I have bought this mug as a gift for 4 different relatives, they love it !!! </li>
	<li> This is a solid mug, not my favorite aesthetically, but it keeps my coffee hot, so I'll take it. </li>
	<li> I bought this mug for myself, to cheer myself up on a bad day, it arrived a few days later, and I felt much 
		better, after drinking hot tea in it, made by my mother. </li>
